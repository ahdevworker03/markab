# Architecture Principles

## Purpose

This document defines the architectural principles that guide the design and implementation of the Vehicle Rental Management Platform.

These principles establish a common set of engineering standards that every technical decision should follow. Their purpose is to promote consistency, maintainability, scalability, and long-term reliability throughout the project.

Whenever multiple implementation options exist, the solution that best aligns with these principles should be preferred.

# Core Philosophy

The architecture should support the business, not dictate it.

Business requirements, user workflows, and the domain model are the primary drivers of the system design.

Technology choices exist to support the business, not the other way around.

---

# Principle 1 — Business-Driven Design

Every feature begins with understanding the business problem.

Implementation decisions should always reflect business requirements rather than technical preferences.

The development process follows this sequence:

Business Requirement

↓

User Flow

↓

Domain Model

↓

Architecture

↓

Database

↓

Backend

↓

Frontend

---

# Principle 2 — Simplicity First

Prefer the simplest solution that satisfies the requirements.

Avoid unnecessary abstractions, premature optimization, and overly complex patterns.

Complexity should only be introduced when it provides measurable value.

---

# Principle 3 — Modular Design

The application should be organized into independent business modules.

Examples include:

- Authentication
- Organizations
- Users
- Customers
- Vehicles
- Rentals
- Maintenance
- Payments

Each module should encapsulate its own responsibilities while interacting with other modules through clearly defined interfaces.

---

# Principle 4 — Separation of Concerns

Each layer of the application should have a single responsibility.

Examples:

- Controllers handle HTTP requests.
- Services implement business rules.
- Repositories manage data access.
- Database stores data.
- Frontend presents information.

Business logic should never be duplicated across multiple layers.

---

# Principle 5 — Domain-Centered Development

The domain model is the foundation of the system.

Entities and business rules should define the architecture rather than database tables or framework conventions.

Changes to the domain should be reflected consistently across the application.

---

# Principle 6 — API-First Communication

Communication between the frontend and backend should occur through well-designed REST APIs.

API contracts should be defined before implementation whenever practical.

Stable and predictable APIs reduce coupling between frontend and backend development.

---

# Principle 7 — Data Integrity

The database is the source of truth.

Business rules should protect data integrity through:

- Validation
- Constraints
- Transactions
- Consistent relationships

Data consistency takes priority over convenience.

---

# Principle 8 — Security by Default

Security should be considered throughout development rather than added later.

The system should follow secure practices for:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Password storage
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Access control

Sensitive information should never be exposed unnecessarily.

---

# Principle 9 — Offline-First Thinking

The application should continue supporting essential business operations during temporary network interruptions.

Core workflows should be designed with synchronization in mind rather than treating offline capability as an afterthought.

---

# Principle 10 — Scalability Through Good Design

The system should be capable of supporting future growth without requiring major architectural changes.

Scalability should be achieved through:

- Modular architecture
- Clear boundaries
- Maintainable code
- Well-defined interfaces

The goal is sustainable evolution rather than over-engineering.

---

# Principle 11 — Documentation-Driven Development

Documentation is part of the development process.

When business behavior changes, the relevant documentation should be updated before or alongside implementation.

The documentation should remain an accurate representation of the product.

---

# Principle 12 — Testability

The architecture should encourage testing.

Components should be designed to be independently testable, reducing dependencies and making business logic easier to verify.

Testing should focus on validating business behavior rather than implementation details.

---

# Principle 13 — Consistency

Consistency is more valuable than personal preference.

Naming conventions, project structure, coding style, API design, and database design should follow agreed standards across the entire codebase.

A predictable system is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

---

# Principle 14 — Continuous Improvement

Architecture is not static.

As the product evolves and new requirements emerge, the architecture may evolve as well.

Changes should be intentional, documented, and based on clear business or technical justification rather than trends or personal preference.

---

# Architectural Decision Framework

Before introducing a new technology, pattern, or architectural change, consider the following questions:

1. Does this solve a real business problem?
2. Is the solution simpler than the alternatives?
3. Does it align with the existing architecture?
4. Will it improve maintainability?
5. Can every developer working on the project understand it?
6. Does it support future growth without unnecessary complexity?
7. Is there a clear justification for introducing it now?

If the answer to these questions is generally yes, the change is likely aligned with the project's architectural principles.

# Summary

The architecture of this project exists to support a reliable, maintainable, and scalable SaaS platform for vehicle rental businesses.

Every engineering decision should reinforce the project's core goals:

- Solve real business problems.
- Keep the system simple.
- Build incrementally.
- Protect data integrity.
- Maintain clear boundaries.
- Learn through implementation.
- Design for long-term sustainability.
