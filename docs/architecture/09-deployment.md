# Deployment

## Purpose

This document defines how the Vehicle Rental Management Platform is deployed, configured, secured, and operated across different environments.

Its purpose is to provide a deployment architecture that is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and suitable for a production SaaS application.

---

# Deployment Goals

The deployment architecture should:

- Be reliable.
- Be easy to maintain.
- Support future growth.
- Minimize downtime.
- Protect business data.
- Allow independent deployment of system components.

---

# Deployment Philosophy

Every system component should be independently deployable.

Frontend, backend, database, and supporting services should remain loosely coupled to simplify maintenance, upgrades, and future migrations.

Deployment decisions should avoid unnecessary vendor lock-in whenever possible.

---

# System Components

The deployed platform consists of:

- Frontend Application
- Backend API
- PostgreSQL Database
- Object Storage
- Email Service
- Monitoring and Logging Services

Each component has a clearly defined responsibility.

---

# Environment Strategy

The platform should maintain separate environments for:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment should have independent configuration and resources.

Production data must never be used directly within development environments.

---

# Configuration Management

Application configuration should be managed through environment variables.

Configuration should never be hardcoded into the application.

Sensitive information such as secrets, API keys, and database credentials must be stored securely.

---

# Build Process

Every deployment should produce reproducible builds.

The build process should:

- Install dependencies.
- Run automated tests.
- Validate application configuration.
- Build production assets.
- Prepare deployment artifacts.

Deployment should only proceed after successful validation.

---

# Deployment Process

Deployments should:

- Be repeatable.
- Minimize service interruption.
- Support rollback when necessary.
- Preserve existing business data.

Application updates should not require manual server configuration whenever possible.

---

# Database Deployment

Database schema changes should be managed through version-controlled migrations.

Schema changes should:

- Be repeatable.
- Be reversible whenever practical.
- Preserve existing data.

Database updates should be coordinated with application deployments.

---

# File Storage

User-uploaded files should be stored separately from the application.

Application deployments should never affect uploaded files.

Object storage should support:

- Images
- Documents
- Future file types

---

# Monitoring

The production environment should continuously monitor:

- Application availability.
- API performance.
- Database health.
- System errors.
- Resource usage.

Monitoring should enable rapid detection of production issues.

---

# Logging

The platform should maintain centralized application logs.

Logs should assist with:

- Debugging.
- Error investigation.
- Performance analysis.
- Operational monitoring.

Sensitive information must never be written to application logs.

---

# Backups

Production data should be backed up automatically.

Backup procedures should:

- Run regularly.
- Be monitored.
- Be tested periodically.
- Support reliable restoration.

Business continuity depends on verified backups.

---

# Disaster Recovery

The deployment architecture should support recovery from unexpected failures.

Recovery planning should include:

- Database restoration.
- Infrastructure recovery.
- Service restoration.
- Data validation.

Recovery procedures should be documented and tested.

---

# Scalability

The deployment architecture should support business growth without significant redesign.

The platform should allow independent scaling of:

- Frontend
- Backend
- Database
- Object Storage

Scaling decisions should minimize operational complexity while maintaining application performance.

---

# Security

Production deployments should enforce:

- HTTPS for all communication.
- Secure environment variable management.
- Least-privilege access.
- Regular security updates.
- Secure secret management.

Security applies to every deployed environment.

---

# Future Expansion

The deployment architecture should support future capabilities such as:

- Automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Multiple production regions.
- Load balancing.
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
- Additional infrastructure services.

These enhancements should integrate without requiring major architectural changes.

---

# Guiding Principle

Every deployment decision should answer one question:

> **Does this provide a reliable, secure, scalable, and maintainable platform that can grow with the business while minimizing operational complexity?**
