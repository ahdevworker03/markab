# Offline First

## Purpose

This document defines how the Vehicle Rental Management Platform operates when internet connectivity is unavailable.

The goal is to ensure business operations continue with minimal interruption while maintaining data consistency across all devices once connectivity is restored.

---

# Offline Goals

The offline architecture should:

- Allow business operations without an internet connection.
- Provide a seamless user experience.
- Preserve data integrity.
- Synchronize changes automatically.
- Minimize the risk of data conflicts.
- Support future scalability.

Offline capability is a core feature of the platform rather than an optional enhancement.

---

# Offline Philosophy

The application should continue working regardless of network availability.

Users should not need to think about whether they are online or offline while performing normal business operations.

Synchronization should happen automatically whenever connectivity becomes available.

The server remains the authoritative source of truth.

---

# Offline Architecture

The platform consists of two data sources:

- Local Storage
- Remote Database

Local storage enables offline operation.

The remote database maintains the authoritative business data.

When online, both remain synchronized.

---

# First Authentication

A user must successfully authenticate while connected to the internet before offline functionality becomes available.

After the initial authentication:

- The authenticated session remains active.
- Previously synchronized data is available locally.
- The application can continue operating without an internet connection.

Authentication itself cannot be performed offline.

---

# Local Data Storage

Business data required for daily operations is stored locally.

Local storage may include:

- Customers
- Vehicles
- Rentals
- Payments
- Maintenance records
- User preferences

Only the information necessary for offline operation should be stored locally.

---

# Offline Operations

While offline, users should be able to perform normal business activities such as:

- Creating customers.
- Updating customer information.
- Managing vehicles.
- Creating rentals.
- Closing rentals.
- Recording payments.
- Viewing previously synchronized data.

Operations are stored locally until synchronization occurs.

---

# Synchronization Strategy

Synchronization begins automatically once internet connectivity is restored.

The synchronization process should:

1. Detect pending local changes.
2. Upload local changes to the server.
3. Retrieve server updates.
4. Resolve conflicts.
5. Update the local database.
6. Confirm synchronization completion.

Users should not need to manually manage synchronization under normal circumstances.

---

# Conflict Resolution

Conflicts may occur when the same record is modified on multiple devices before synchronization.

The backend is responsible for detecting and resolving conflicts.

Conflict resolution rules should prioritize preserving business data while preventing inconsistencies.

Whenever possible, conflict handling should occur automatically.

Cases requiring user intervention should be minimized.

---

# Synchronization Triggers

Synchronization should occur when:

- The application starts.
- Internet connectivity is restored.
- The user manually requests synchronization.
- A scheduled synchronization interval is reached.

The application should avoid unnecessary synchronization requests.

---

# Synchronization Status

The application should always communicate synchronization status clearly.

Typical states include:

- Online
- Offline
- Synchronizing
- Up to Date
- Synchronization Failed

Users should understand whether their changes have been synchronized.

---

# Data Ownership

The server is the authoritative source of business data.

Local storage exists to improve availability and user experience.

Successful synchronization updates both the local data and the server to maintain consistency.

---

# Security Considerations

Offline capability must not reduce security.

The platform should:

- Require an initial authenticated login.
- Protect locally stored data.
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Validate all synchronized data on the server.

Security rules remain enforced after synchronization.

---

# Limitations

Certain operations require an active internet connection, including:

- Initial authentication.
- Password reset.
- Downloading application updates.
- Features that depend on external services.

These limitations should be communicated clearly to users.

---

# Future Expansion

The offline architecture should support future improvements such as:

- Background synchronization.
- More advanced conflict resolution.
- Selective synchronization.
- Multiple device synchronization.
- Performance optimizations.

These enhancements should build upon the existing architecture without requiring major redesign.

---

# Guiding Principle

Every offline design decision should answer one question:

> **Does this allow users to continue running their business reliably without internet connectivity while preserving data consistency and integrity?**
