name: monorepo
description: Monorepo architecture with Turborepo or Nx, managing multiple applications and shared packages, dependency management, build pipeline optimization, caching strategies, task orchestration, code sharing between frontend and backend, workspace configuration, and deployment strategies for monorepos. Applicable when setting up or maintaining a monorepo, managing shared code between apps, optimizing build times with caching, or structuring multi-package repositories.

# Monorepo

## Purpose

This skill guides the agent in designing, managing, and optimizing monorepos using modern build tools. A monorepo consolidates multiple projects (frontend, backend, shared libraries, tooling) into a single repository with a unified dependency graph and build pipeline. The skill focuses on workspace configuration, task orchestration, caching, dependency management, and code sharing — ensuring fast builds, consistent tooling, and developer productivity.

---

## When to Load

- User is setting up or maintaining a monorepo structure with multiple packages or applications.
- User mentions: `monorepo`, `Turborepo`, `Nx`, `workspace`, `package`, `shared library`, `build pipeline`, `caching`, `task orchestration`, `dependency graph`.
- User is configuring `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, or workspace manifests.
- User asks about sharing code between frontend and backend, managing dependencies across packages, or optimizing build performance in a monorepo.

---

## When NOT to Load

- Single-package applications without multiple projects.
- General JavaScript/TypeScript development outside the monorepo context.
- Pure frontend or backend implementation without package management.
- Infrastructure or deployment configuration unrelated to monorepo structure.

## Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** – All projects, shared libraries, and tooling live in one repository with a unified dependency graph. Changes are atomic and versioned together.
2. **Fast, Incremental Builds** – Use caching and task orchestration to rebuild only what changed. A well-configured monorepo should have near-instantaneous builds for local development and CI/CD.
3. **Shared Code, But Independent Deployment** – Share code between applications (e.g., shared types, utilities, UI components) while maintaining independent deployable units. Each application can be deployed separately.
4. **Dependency Management** – All dependencies are resolved from a single `node_modules` (hoisted) or isolated per package (workspace protocols). Ensure consistent versions across packages.
5. **Task Consistency** – Define common tasks (dev, build, test, lint, format) across all packages with the same interface. Use workspace-level task definitions for uniformity.

## Decision Rules

### Tooling Selection

- **IF** the monorepo contains a mix of frontend (React) and backend (Express/Prisma) applications with shared TypeScript packages, **THEN** use Turborepo (from Vercel) for its simplicity, excellent caching, and integration with Vercel deployments.
- **IF** the monorepo has many advanced features (e.g., distributed caching, granular dependency graph visualization, extensive plugin system), **THEN** consider Nx, but be aware it has a steeper learning curve.
- **IF** the team has limited monorepo experience, **THEN** start with Turborepo and extend as needed.

### Workspace Configuration

- **IF** using Turborepo, **THEN** define the workspace in the root `package.json` with `"workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]` (or a similar glob pattern).
- **IF** using npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces, **THEN** choose a package manager that supports workspaces (pnpm is recommended for monorepos due to its efficiency).
- **IF** using pnpm, **THEN** configure `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with glob patterns.

### Task Pipeline

- **IF** defining tasks in `turbo.json`, **THEN** specify `dependsOn` for task dependencies (e.g., `"build": { "dependsOn": ["^build"] }` to build dependencies first).
- **IF** using caching, **THEN** set `inputs` to define file globs that invalidate the cache (e.g., `["src/**/*.ts"]`).
- **IF** tasks produce artifacts (e.g., `dist/`, `build/`), **THEN** define `outputs` to cache the artifacts.
- **IF** a task should not be cached (e.g., tests with external side effects), **THEN** set `"cache": false`.

### Code Sharing Between Apps

- **IF** sharing code between frontend and backend (e.g., validation schemas, API types, utility functions), **THEN** place them in a `packages/shared` or `packages/types` directory.
- **IF** sharing React UI components between multiple frontend apps, **THEN** create a `packages/ui` package that exports the components.
- **IF** sharing configuration (e.g., ESLint config, TypeScript config), **THEN** place them in `packages/config/*` and reference them via workspace protocols.
- **ALWAYS** use workspace protocol (`"workspace:*"` or `"*"` in pnpm) to reference sibling packages.

### Dependency Management

- **IF** multiple packages depend on the same external library, **THEN** consider hoisting the dependency to the root to reduce duplicate installs.
- **IF** a package is used only internally (e.g., shared utilities), **THEN** keep it as a workspace dependency; do not publish to npm unless necessary.
- **IF** a package is public and consumed by external projects, **THEN** set `"private": false` and manage versioning independently.

### Versioning and Publishing

- **IF** all packages are versioned together (lockstep), **THEN** use a single version across all packages.
- **IF** packages are versioned independently, **THEN** use tools like Changesets to manage version bumps and changelogs.
- **IF** the monorepo contains apps (not libraries), **THEN** apps are not published; only internal packages may be versioned.

## Best Practices

1. **Use pnpm for efficiency** – pnpm is faster and uses less disk space than npm or yarn in monorepos. It also supports `workspace:*` protocols elegantly.
2. **Define root-level scripts** – In the root `package.json`, define scripts like `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint` that run across all workspaces using `turbo run dev`, etc.
3. **Use `.turbo` caching** – Place `.turbo` in `.gitignore` to avoid committing cache. The cache is local to the developer or CI and should not be shared via git.
4. **Use `turbo prune` for deployment** – When deploying a single app, use `turbo prune` to create a minimal workspace with only the needed packages, reducing deployment size.
5. **Keep shared packages focused** – Each shared package should have a single responsibility (e.g., `@repo/types`, `@repo/ui`, `@repo/config`). Avoid "god" packages that become too broad.
6. **Use TypeScript project references** – In a TypeScript monorepo, enable project references to improve build times and type-checking performance.
7. **Use consistent tooling versions** – Pin tool versions (Node, pnpm, Turborepo) in the repository to avoid compatibility issues. Use a `.tool-versions` or `.nvmrc` file.
8. **Lint and format across the monorepo** – Use root-level ESLint and Prettier configurations that apply to all packages.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                         | Why it is wrong                                            | Correct approach                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Every package has its own build tool config          | Duplicate configurations; difficult to maintain.           | Extract common configs into shared packages.                                      |
| Not using caching in CI                              | Wastes time rebuilding unchanged packages.                 | Configure Turborepo/Nx with caching in CI and persist the cache.                  |
| Manually building packages in order                  | Relies on developer order; easy to make mistakes.          | Use task orchestration (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`) to let the tool handle ordering. |
| Committing lockfiles from different package managers | Causes conflicts and inconsistent installs.                | Use a single package manager across the entire monorepo.                          |
| Creating circular dependencies between packages      | Build order becomes impossible; leads to errors.           | Refactor to break cycles.                                                         |
| Not using workspace protocols for internal packages  | Harder to update; accidental publishing of stale versions. | Use `workspace:*` or similar to link packages.                                    |
| Ignoring `.gitignore` for build artifacts            | Cache and dist files bloat the repository.                 | Always ignore `dist`, `build`, `.turbo`, `.nx`.                                   |

## Common Mistakes & Edge Cases

| Mistake                                                 | Symptom                                                     | Solution                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Turborepo cache not invalidating                        | Builds use stale cache after code changes.                  | Check `inputs` in `turbo.json`; include all source files that affect the task. |
| Running `turbo run build` without building dependencies | Dependent packages missing.                                 | Set `dependsOn: ["^build"]` to build dependencies first.                       |
| Forgetting to add new package to workspace glob         | New package is ignored.                                     | Update workspace glob patterns to include the new package.                     |
| Using `file:` protocols for local packages              | Does not work with all package managers in monorepos.       | Use `workspace:*` (pnpm) or `*` (npm/yarn workspaces).                         |
| Not using `turbo prune` for deployment                  | Deployment artifacts include unused packages.               | Use `turbo prune` to isolate the application for deployment.                   |
| TypeScript project references not configured            | Type-checking slow and cross-package imports not optimized. | Enable project references in `tsconfig.json`.                                  |
| Inconsistent Node.js versions across dev and CI         | Build fails in CI due to Node version mismatch.             | Use `.nvmrc` or `.tool-versions` to pin Node version.                          |
